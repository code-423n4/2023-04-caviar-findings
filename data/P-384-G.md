# Struct packing can be used here to save gas
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-caviar/blob/main/src/EthRouter.sol#L48
    struct Buy {
        address payable pool;
        address nft;
        uint256[] tokenIds;
        uint256[] tokenWeights;
        PrivatePool.MerkleMultiProof proof;
        uint256 baseTokenAmount;
        bool isPublicPool;
    }

Can be packed as:
struct Buy {
    bool isPublicPool;
    address payable pool;
    address nft;
    uint256[] tokenIds;
    uint256[] tokenWeights;
    PrivatePool.MerkleMultiProof proof;
    uint256 baseTokenAmount;
}

Since bool takes up 1Byte and address takes up 20Bytes, which would store isPublicPool and pool in the same storge slot

Same for https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-caviar/blob/main/src/EthRouter.sol#L58
struct Sell {
    address payable pool;
    address nft;
    uint256[] tokenIds;
    uint256[] tokenWeights;
    PrivatePool.MerkleMultiProof proof;
    IStolenNftOracle.Message[] stolenNftProofs;
    bool isPublicPool;
    bytes32[][] publicPoolProofs;
}
Can be packed as:
struct Sell {
    bool isPublicPool;
    address payable pool;
    address nft;
    uint256[] tokenIds;
    uint256[] tokenWeights;
    PrivatePool.MerkleMultiProof proof;
    IStolenNftOracle.Message[] stolenNftProofs;
    bytes32[][] publicPoolProofs;
}
For the same reasons as above for the Buy struct.
