    constructor(address _factory, address _royaltyRegistry, address _stolenNftOracle) {

## FUNCTIONS GUARANTEED TO REVERT WHEN CALLED BY NORMAL USERS CAN BE MARKED PAYABLE
If a function modifier or require such as onlyOwner/onlyX is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as payable will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided. The extra opcodes avoided are CALLVALUE(2), DUP1(3), ISZERO(3), PUSH2(3), JUMPI(10), PUSH1(3), DUP1(3), REVERT(0), JUMPDEST(1), POP(2) which costs an average of about 21 gas per call to the function, in addition to the extra deployment cost.

## CAN MAKE THE VARIABLE OUTSIDE THE LOOP TO SAVE GAS
Make it outside and only use it inside.

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < buys.length; i++) {
            if (buys[i].isPublicPool) {
                // execute the buy against a public pool
                uint256 inputAmount = Pair(buys[i].pool).nftBuy{value: buys[i].baseTokenAmount}(
                    buys[i].tokenIds, buys[i].baseTokenAmount, 0
                );

## USAGE OF UINT/INT SMALLER THAN 32 BYTES (256 BITS) INCURS OVERHEAD
When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contractâ€™s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.
Each operation involving a uint8 costs an extra 22-28 gas (depending on whether the other operand is also a variable of type uint8) as compared to ones involving uint256, due to the compiler having to clear the higher bits of the memory word before operating on the uint8, as well as the associated stack operations of doing so. Use a larger size then downcast where needed.
