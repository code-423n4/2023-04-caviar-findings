## Findings

### 1- `storage` variable should be cached into `memory` variables instead of re-reading them :

The instances below point to the second+ access of a state variable within a function, the caching of a state variable replaces each Gwarmaccess (100 gas) with a much cheaper stack read, thus saves **100gas** for each instance.

### 2- `salePrice` should be calculated outside the for loop :

In the `sell` function from the PrivatePool contract, the `salePrice` value should be calculated outside of the for loop to save gas, as its value will remain the same throughout the iterations.

There is 1 instances of this issue:

File: PrivatePool.sol [Line 335](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-caviar/blob/main/src/PrivatePool.sol#L335)
```
uint256 salePrice = (netOutputAmount + feeAmount + protocolFeeAmount) / tokenIds.length;
```

### 3- Usage of `uints/ints` smaller than 32 bytes (256 bits) incurs overhead (saves ~1127 gas):

When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contractâ€™s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size as you can check [here](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/internals/layout_in_storage.html).

So use `uint256`/`int256` for state variables and then downcast to lower sizes where needed.

```
uint16 public protocolFeeRate;
```

```
uint56 public changeFee;
```

[Line 91](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-caviar/blob/main/src/PrivatePool.sol#L91)
```
uint16 public feeRate;
```

[Line 104](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-caviar/blob/main/src/PrivatePool.sol#L104)
```
uint128 public virtualBaseTokenReserves;
```

[Line 112](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-caviar/blob/main/src/PrivatePool.sol#L112)
```
uint128 public virtualNftReserves;
```

### 4- `x += y/x -= y` costs more gas than `x = x + y/x = x - y` for state variables :

Using the addition operator instead of plus-equals saves **113 gas** as explained [here](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/cbbfb267425b898e5be734d4008d4fe8)

There are 4 instances of this issue:

```
File: PrivatePool.sol

230     virtualBaseTokenReserves += uint128(netInputAmount - feeAmount - protocolFeeAmount);
231     virtualNftReserves -= uint128(weightSum);
323     virtualBaseTokenReserves -= uint128(netOutputAmount + protocolFeeAmount + feeAmount);
324     virtualNftReserves += uint128(weightSum);
```


### 5- Input check statements should be placed at the start of the functions :

The check statements on the functions input values should be placed at the beginning of the functions to avoid stack too deep errors and save gas.

There are 2 instances of this issue:

File: PrivatePool.sol [Line 225](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-caviar/blob/main/src/PrivatePool.sol#L225)
```
if (baseToken != address(0) && msg.value > 0) revert InvalidEthAmount();
```

File: PrivatePool.sol [Line 316-318](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-caviar/blob/main/src/PrivatePool.sol#L316-L318)
```
if (useStolenNftOracle) {
    IStolenNftOracle(stolenNftOracle).validateTokensAreNotStolen(nft, tokenIds, stolenNftProofs);
}
```

### 6- Duplicated input check statements should be refactored to a modifier :

The following check statements are repeated multiple times (4) :

```
File: EthRouter.sol

101     if (block.timestamp > deadline && deadline != 0) {
            revert DeadlinePassed();
        }
154     if (block.timestamp > deadline && deadline != 0) {
            revert DeadlinePassed();
        }
228     if (block.timestamp > deadline && deadline != 0) {
            revert DeadlinePassed();
        }
256     if (block.timestamp > deadline && deadline != 0) {
            revert DeadlinePassed();
        }
```

Because this check is done at the start of the function it can be refactored into a modifier to save gas, it should be replaced by a `validDeadline` modifier as follow :

```
modifier validDeadline(uint256 deadline){
    if (block.timestamp > deadline && deadline != 0) {
        revert DeadlinePassed();
    }
    _;
}
```


### 7- `public` functions not called by the contract should be declared `external` instead :

The `public` functions that are not called inside the contract should be declared `external` instead to save gas.
