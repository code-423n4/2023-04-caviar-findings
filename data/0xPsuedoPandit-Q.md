Code existence check is missing, the problem is inside the create function in Factory.sol there is no check whether the _baseToken address has code or not and also the safeTransferLib states that  "Note that none of the functions in this library check that a token has code at all! That responsibility is delegated to the caller." this might result in unexpected results.
