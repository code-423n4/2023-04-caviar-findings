# For functions, follow solidity standard naming conventions:
Functions should be grouped according to their visibility and ordered:

1)constructor
2)receive function (if exists)
3)fallback function (if exists)
4)external
5)public
6)internal
7)private
https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.18/style-guide.html

Contracts with this convention issue:
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-caviar/blob/main/src/EthRouter.sol#L88 - Technically receive should come after the constructor
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-caviar/blob/main/src/PrivatePool.sol#L134 - Technically receive should come after the constructor & external functions are after public functions but they should be before them.


# Inconsistent use of bytes32 and bytes
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-caviar/blob/main/src/interfaces/IStolenNftOracle.sol#L7 - Since bytes is an alias for bytes32 you should use one (ideally bytes32 to be more explicit on intentions).
Using both forms in the same struct indicates that this isn't understood.
