[G1]Usage of uints/ints smaller than 32 bytes (256 bits) incurs overhead

https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-caviar/blob/cd8a92667bcb6657f70657183769c244d04c015c/src/Factory.sol#L51

When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contracts gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.

[G2]Use nested if and, avoid multiple check combinations
https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-04-caviar/blob/cd8a92667bcb6657f70657183769c244d04c015c/src/Factory.sol#L87

Using nested is cheaper than using && multiple check combinations. There are more advantages, such as easier to read code and better coverage reports.
